**Web Service** 
----------------

  A Web service is a way for two machines to communicate with each other over a `network.`
 
**API(Application Programming Interface)** 
-------------------------------------------

  A set of definitions and protocols that allow one application to communicate with another application.
  Mostly we deal with web APIs only which are nothing but web services only. But there are APIs also used wihtout network connection. 

> _All web services are API, not all APIs are web service._

**API request** 
----------------

  An API request allows you to retrieve data from a data source, or to send data. 

**REST API** 
----------------

  A REST API is a standardized architecture style for creating a Web Service API. One of the requirements to be a REST API is 
  the utilization of HTTP methods to make a request over a network.
