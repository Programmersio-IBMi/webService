**Web Service** 

  A Web service is a way for two machines to communicate with each other over a `network.`
 
**API(Application Programming Interface)** 

  A set of definitions and protocols that allow one application to communicate with another application.
  Mostly we deal with web APIs only which are web services only. But there are APIs also used wihtout network connection. 

> _All web services are API, not all APIs are web service._
